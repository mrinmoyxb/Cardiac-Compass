# 🩺 Cardiac Compass
An Android application built using **`Kotlin, Python and Jetpack Compose`** and uses Machine Learning Algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) to predict heart disease with 97% accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives
There are two main objectives of this project:

**I.** First objective of this project is to build an Android Application that can predict whether a person has a probability of heart disease or not based on the inputs provided by the user.  
**II.** The Android Application should use a Machine Learning model to generate the outcome.
